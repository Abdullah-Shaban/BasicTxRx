About
=====

The Wireless Testbed Academy contains source code that can be run on open wireless experimental testbeds. The following open experimentation/testing facilities are supported:
* iMinds [w-iLab.t](http://doc.ilabt.iminds.be/ilabt-documentation/wilabfacility.html)
* TUB [TWIST](http://www.twist.tu-berlin.de/wiki)
* TCD IRIS
* TUD
* JSI [LOG-a-TEC](http://log-a-tec.eu/overview.html)


Simple transmit source code
===========================
This code gives a preview on how a simple transmit (Tx) experiment is implemented using the APIs available on the individual testbeds. Note that you need to request an account to obtain access right to the testbeds in order to be able to try and run the code. The access to most of the testbeds is open.

For more details, browse the testbed specific Tx code, including the respective README file and comments from the source code.


Other resources
===============
Videos of demos and tutorials on the facilities are available on the project [web site](http://www.crew-project.eu/demos) and on the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/FP7ictCREW).
