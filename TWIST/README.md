# Simple transmit source code

This code gives a preview on how a simple transmit (Tx) experiment is implemented using the APIs available on the individual testbeds. Note that you need to request an account to obtain access right to the testbeds in order to be able to try and run the code. The access to most of the testbeds is open.
