Simple receive example
======================


LOG-a-TEC
---------

The `logatec.py` script performs a simple spectrum sensing experiment in
the 2.4 GHz band on a sensor node in the City Center cluster of the LOG-a-TEC
testbed.

Experiments running on LOG-a-TEC testbed are controlled over the Internet from
a Python script running on the user's computer. To run an experiment, you need
the following installed on your system:

 * Python 2.7 (usually already installed on Linux systems) and
 * a valid username and password for the LOG-a-TEC testbed saved in `.alhrc` in
   your home directory (see https://github.com/sensorlab/vesna-alh-tools for
   details).

To install required Python packages, run:

    $ pip install --user -r requirements.txt

To run the experiment:

    $ python logatec.py

The script saves the recorded spectrogram data into `logatec.csv` file in the
current directory. This is a text-based file that is simple to import into
Matlab or other software. To visualize using GNU Plot, run:

    $ gnuplot -p basicrx.gnuplot

See comments in the `logatec.py` script for more details.
