Simple transmitter example
===================

The 'tx_application.ns' file describes the topology of the USRP and the host server on the testbed.
The 'tx_application.grc' file implements a simple QPSK transmitter in GNU Radio Companion (GRC).
The 'tx_application.png' file contains a screenshot of the GRC flow graph.
The 'tx_application.py' file is the python file automatically generated by GRC.

Requirements:

  * [Install Open VPN client](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html)
  * [Request an w-iLab.t testbed account](http://ilabt.iminds.be/gettingstarted)
  * [Basic knowledge of the w-iLab.t Zwijnaarde testbed](http://ilabt.iminds.be/node/93)
  * [Basic knowledge of using USRP in w-iLab.t Zwijnaarde testbed](http://doc.ilabt.iminds.be/ilabt-documentation/wilabfacility.html#using-the-usrp-devices)

To run the transmitter:

    $ reserve 1 USRP and 1 server (can be both server1P or server5P) on the testbed reservation page
    $ define an emulab experiment using the tx_application.ns file (if it does not exist), adapt the USRP and server according to reservation and swap in the experiment
    $ log onto the reserved server5P with your w-iLab.t account graphically (with -X option if using ssh client)
    $ verify the connection between the server and USRP
    $ launch GRC by running the command: grc
    $ open the 'tx_application.grc' with GRC, adapt the IP address of the USRP
    $ execute the flow graph with the "run" button 
    $ alternatively we can directly run the python file without using GRC to start the transmission.

This .grc file consists of three components:
  * Vector source
    * Provides bits to the modulator
  * Constellation Modulator
    * Performs the QPSK modulation of the bits to be transmitted
  * USRP sink
    * Sends the sample from the modulator to USRP and transmits over the air
