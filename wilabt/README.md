Simple receiver example
===================

iMinds
-----

The 'rx_application.ns' file describes the topology of the USRP and the host server on the testbed.
The 'rx_application.grc' file implements a simple QPSK receiver in GNU Radio Companion (GRC).
The 'rx_application.png' file contains a screenshot of the GRC flow graph.
The 'rx_application.py' file is the python file automatically generated by GRC.

Requirements:

  * [Install Open VPN client](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html)
  * [Request an w-iLab.t testbed account](http://ilabt.iminds.be/gettingstarted)
  * [Basic knowledge of the w-iLab.t Zwijnaarde testbed](http://ilabt.iminds.be/node/93)
  * [Basic knowledge of using USRP in w-iLab.t Zwijnaarde testbed](http://doc.ilabt.iminds.be/ilabt-documentation/wilabfacility.html#using-the-usrp-devices)

To run the receiver:

    $ reserve 1 USRP and 1 server (can be both server1P or server5P) on the testbed reservation page
    $ define an emulab experiment using the rx_application.ns file (if it does not exist), adapt the USRP and server according to reservation and swap in the experiment
    $ log onto the reserved server with your w-iLab.t account graphically (with -X option if using ssh client)
    $ verify the connection between the server and USRP
    $ launch GRC by running the command: grc
    $ open the 'rx_application.grc' with GRC, adapt the IP address of the USRP 
    $ execute the flow graph with the "run" button 
    $ alternatively we can directly run the python file without using GRC to start the receiver.

This .grc file consists of the following components:
  * USRP source
    * Provides raw samples from the USRP
  * Poly phase clock sync
    * Performs clock correction using poly phase filter
  * LMS DD equalizer
    * Compensates for non-flat channel response
  * Costas loop
    * Performs fine clock adjustment and lock to a particular constellation
  * QT GUI constellation sink
    * Shows the constellation diagram after the costas loop   
  * Constellation receiver
    * Produces symbols based on the constellation  
  * Map
    * Maps symbols into bits         
  * Differential decoder
    * Decodes the symbols based on the difference between cocnsecutive symbols
  * Unpack K bits
    * Deserializes the bits
  * Char to float
    * Converts the storage format into float
  * QT GUI time sink
    * Plots the received bits in a scope
